Returnal-like Bullet Hell Framework
/********************/
[Goal (In comparison with previous 2D bullet hell framework)]

1. In 3D. (Obviously)

2. Less gungeon-like architecture. 
//Gungeon-like bullet hell supports multi-layer transform parenting.
//While in Returnal, most patterns are formed by single level parenting.

3. Dynamic bullet movement.
//In previous bullet hell framework, most bullets movement are pre-defined.
//That is, after a bullet fires, its movement is completely indepentant and deterministic.
//In Returnal however, bullets have dynamic behaviour (For example: tracking player)

4. Support "Actual" collision.
//In previous bullet hell framework, we assumed that there is no obstacles. (walls, debris ... etc) The only thing the bullets might hit is the player. (Or overbound)
//In Returnal, bullets collide with physic objects.

[Problems]

1. Position Update
    Matrix4x4
    Pre-defined movement v.s. Attach bullets to an actual gameobjects (And modify gameobjects during runtime)

2. Collision Detection
    Unity Raycast (Multi-thread?)
    [Nope] Custom Raycast (Nope, performance sucks with unknown reasons)

3. Rendering
    [Solved (kinda?)] Graphics.DrawMeshInstanced
